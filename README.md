### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where the protagonist discovers a 'digital relic'—an old device with a profound, forgotten message—that sends them on a new thread of their quest.
- Create a character profile for another 'seeker' who arrives at the Cathedral of Process, detailing their broken tech and the spiritual void it represents.
- Draft a 'found text'—a memo, error log, or chat transcript—recovered from a device in the mountain that offers a cryptic spiritual insight.
- Imagine a scene where the protagonist attempts to explain the 'truth' of the mountain to a purely pragmatic, tech-optimist friend, with dialogue that highlights the core conflict.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a simple, web-based 'Digital Relic Generator' that creates pixel-art images of obsolete devices (PDA, floppy disk, etc.) with a user-input 'memo' of spiritual/poetic text displayed on screen.
- Create a 'Cathedral of Process' soundscape mix using ambient tones, glitch sounds, and processed notifications, designed to evoke the novel's setting for writing or meditation.
